    The requirements gathering stage is a critical early step in software development. During this phase, everyone involved—such as clients, users, and developers—works together to determine what the software should do and how it should function. This process is essential because it lays the groundwork for the entire project. By identifying the needs and goals early on, teams can make sure the software meets user expectations and operates effectively. In this stage, teams take time to carefully discuss and document all the features and functions the software needs. This step helps prevent confusion. When requirements are clear from the beginning, the team can avoid mistakes or the need to make changes later. Without clear requirements, the project is likely going to be unorganised which wastes time and resources. Developers know exactly what they need to build, and clients or users have a clear understanding of what to expect. This phase acts as a roadmap, guiding the design, development, and testing processes. In conclusion, good requirements gathering ensures that the software will deliver value and successfully meet its intended purpose.

In software design, communication is very important to ensure that all participants are on the same page regarding the goals, requirements and challenges of the project. When a team is not well-coordinated, there is a real risk that it would go off in the wrong direction, potentially using valuable resources, but rarely achieving planned goals. 3 key areas of communication are: Listening, openness and feedback. By listening, it becomes easier to relay the information, and the way it is received makes it clearly understood with no mixture of issues. The openness means that the members are given freedom to share ideas and issues that can be a concern in the workteams. Feedback makes it possible for a group to learn from its mistakes by correcting misunderstandings and immensely improving the way a group wants to get to by achieving project objectives.
Communication is a very large factor in hockey. During a recent hockey game, I yelled to my teammate to cover my guy, but my directions were not clear. My teammate didn’t understand and this breakdown led to the other team scoring.
Reflecting on class group activities, one of the lessons we did was a task, where we were explaining to a partner how to draw an image in a set step by step plan. Nonetheless, my attempt at guiding them to draw what I wanted resulted in my partner drawing something entirely different. I learned how quickly a misunderstanding can occur when instructions are vague. Looking back, there should have provided deeper descriptions of the instructions and pause after each given to ensure my partner understood. It will be important in future to follow this lesson by paying attention to clarity and confirmation of ideas during all aspects of life.

  Simplicity in design is all about making sure that the systems or interfaces that need to be put in place are easy to comprehend, work with, and update. Simplicity in software design is leaving out unrelated and confusing parts by only providing users with relevant aspects and properly arranging features. It helps to prevent user overload and guarantee that the users immediately understand several or one number of functions and perform their tasks without the need for additional assistance. Simplicity, in my opinion, is one of the most important design principles, if there isn’t simplicity the user can be driven away from the software. One example is my digital thermostat at home. It has big buttons for raising or lowering the temperature and a screen to display the values. It had no complex features that might have forced the company to develop a manual to teach customers how to use it, which underlined the fact that products should be made simple and easy to use. When I first started using a mobile banking app, I didn’t understand how to work it at first because it had a confusing design, there were too many sub-categories under another sub-category. Things like e-transfers were exceptionally hidden, I often found myself searching up how to do something. Had simplicity been a bigger principle in the applications design, the usability would be much better and not as confusing. Something like this is unlikely to, but may cause customers to shy away from banking with that company. Obviously, simplicity is not that big of a factor if the user has used the app for a while because they will know how to do everything. But simplicity will keep users engaged with the software at first, which will have them keep coming back.

In software design, communication is very important to ensure that all participants are on the same page regarding the goals, requirements and challenges of the project. When a team is not well-coordinated, there is a real risk that it would go off in the wrong direction, potentially using valuable resources, but rarely achieving planned goals. 3 key areas of communication are: Listening, openness and feedback. By listening, it becomes easier to relay the information, and the way it is received makes it clearly understood with no mixture of issues. The openness means that the members are given freedom to share ideas and issues that can be a concern in the workteams. Feedback makes it possible for a group to learn from its mistakes by correcting misunderstandings and immensely improving the way a group wants to get to by achieving project objectives.
Communication is a very large factor in hockey. During a recent hockey game, I yelled to my teammate to cover my guy, but my directions were not clear. My teammate didn’t understand and this breakdown led to the other team scoring.
Reflecting on class group activities, one of the lessons we did was a task, where we were explaining to a partner how to draw an image in a set step by step plan. Nonetheless, my attempt at guiding them to draw what I wanted resulted in my partner drawing something entirely different. I learned how quickly a misunderstanding can occur when instructions are vague. Looking back, there should have provided deeper descriptions of the instructions and pause after each given to ensure my partner understood. It will be important in future to follow this lesson by paying attention to clarity and confirmation of ideas during all aspects of life.
